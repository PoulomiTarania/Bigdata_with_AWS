# Bigdata_with_AWS
This project leverages EC2, Docker, and Elasticsearch to process NYC Fire Incident Dispatch data. A Docker-contained Python script ingests the dataset from NYC Open Data, streaming it to an AWS OpenSearch cluster. The concluding step involves crafting visualizations for better data understanding, offering insights into extensive fire incident data.

BACKGROUND 
The Fire Incident Dispatch Data for New York City is a valuable resource that provides detailed information about emergency incidents reported to the Fire Department. With 8.6 million records spanning from 2005 to 2022 and 29 data fields, this dataset offers a comprehensive view of the nature and distribution of fire incidents in the city.

To make sense of this vast dataset, I focused on a subset of 11 data fields that I deemed most relevant for providing insights into the incidents. 

By visualizing this subset of data, I was able to uncover patterns and trends that shed light on emergency response in New York City. Using a variety of charts, such as pie charts, bar charts, word maps, heat maps, and time series, I was able to identify key insights from the data.
The project dives into each chart in detail, providing a deeper understanding of the data and its implications for emergency response in the city. Ultimately, this project contributes to our understanding of emergency incidents in New York City with the help of data visualizations.
