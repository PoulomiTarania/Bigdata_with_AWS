# Bigdata_with_AWS
This project leverages EC2, Docker, and Elasticsearch to process NYC Fire Incident Dispatch data. A Docker-contained Python script ingests the dataset from NYC Open Data, streaming it to an AWS OpenSearch cluster. The concluding step involves crafting visualizations for better data understanding, offering insights into extensive fire incident data.
